# Simulation-of-Quantum-Channel
Presently the work done in the field of quantum cryptography is primarily theoretical, the purpose of this paper is to showcase its implementation in an observable manner. Due to the complex nature of quantum networks, a physical implementation of the same is not feasible. Hence a simulation has been is implemented via the use of NS-3 (Network Simulator Version 3).

This project is based on the work done by Miralem Mehic in his paper, "Implementation of quantum key distribution network
simulation module in the network simulator NS-3".
